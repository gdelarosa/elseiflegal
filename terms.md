# Terms of Service

Effective: Feb 10, 2023

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a contract between you and Gina De La Rosa aka Else If. They govern your use of Else If's products, mobile apps, sites, services, and content (“Services”).

By using Else If, you agree to these Terms. If you don’t agree to any of the Terms, you can’t use Else If.

We can change these Terms at any time. We keep [a historical record of all changes to our Terms on GitHub](https://github.com/elseiflegal). If a change is material, we’ll let you know before they take effect. By using Else If on or after that effective date, you agree to the new Terms. If you don’t agree to them, you should delete the app before they take effect, otherwise your use of the Services will be subject to the new Terms.

## Content rights & responsibilities

You own the rights to the content you upload on Else If.

We will never sell your content to third parties without your explicit permission.

You’re responsible for the content you upload. This means you assume all risks related to it, including someone else’s reliance on its accuracy, or claims relating to intellectual property or other legal rights.


## Our content and services

We reserve all rights in Else If's look and feel. You may not copy or adapt any portion of our code or visual design elements (including logos) without express written permission from Else If unless otherwise permitted by law.

You may not do, or try to do, the following: (1) access or tamper with non-public areas of the Services, our computer systems, or the systems of our technical providers; (2) access or search the Services by any means other than the currently available, published interfaces (e.g. mobile apps) that we provide; (3) forge any TCP/IP packet header or any part of the header information in any email or posting, or in any way use the Services to send altered, deceptive, or false source-identifying information; or (4) interfere with, or disrupt, the access of any user, host, or network, including sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, mail-bombing the Services, or by scripting the creation of content or accounts in such a manner as to interfere with or create an undue burden on the Services.

Crawling the Services is allowed if done in accordance with the provisions of our robots.txt file, but scraping the Services is prohibited.

We may change, terminate, or restrict access to any aspect of the service, at any time, without notice.

## Incorporated rules and policies

If you’re outside the United States, you consent to letting Else If transfer, store, and process your information (including your personal information and content) in and out of the United States.

To enable a functioning community, we have rules that are available within the product and may change over time. Under our [Copyright and DMCA Policy](https://github.com/elseiflegal/legal/blob/main/dmca.md), we’ll remove material after receiving a valid takedown notice.

## Miscellaneous

*Disclaimer of warranty.* Else If provides the Services to you as is. You use them at your own risk and discretion. That means they don’t come with any warranty. None express, none implied. No implied warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, availability, security, title or non-infringement.

*Limitation of Liability.* Else If won’t be liable to you for any damages that arise from your using the Services. This includes if the Services are hacked or unavailable. This includes all types of damages (indirect, incidental, consequential, special or exemplary). And it includes all kinds of legal claims, such as breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort, or any other loss.

*No waiver.* If Else If doesn’t exercise a particular right under these Terms, that doesn’t waive it.

*Severability.* If any provision of these terms is found invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, you agree that the court should try to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision and that other provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect.

*Choice of law and jurisdiction.* These Terms are governed by California law, without reference to its conflict of laws provisions. You agree that any suit arising from the Services must take place in a court located in San Francisco, California.

*Entire agreement.* These Terms (including any document incorporated by reference into them) are the whole agreement between Else If and you concerning the Services.
